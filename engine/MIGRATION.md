# Migration Summary: Orcha-1 to Engine

## Overview
We've successfully restructured the project by:

1. Renaming the `RP2A` directory to `P2A`
2. Creating a new `engine` directory with all the files from `orcha-1`
3. Updating all references to old directory names in code and documentation
4. Creating migration and validation scripts

## New Directory Structure

```
D:\dev\orcha-1\
├── engine/           # New main project directory
│   ├── mcp_server/   # MCP Server component
│   ├── proxy/        # API Proxy component
│   ├── P2A/          # P2A component (renamed from RP2A)
│   ├── schemas/      # Schema definitions
│   └── scripts/      # Utility scripts
└── orcha-1/          # Original directory (preserved)
```

## Migration Scripts
The following scripts were created to assist with the migration:

1. `migrate-to-engine.ps1` - Copies files from orcha-1 to engine
2. `validate-engine-setup.ps1` - Verifies all required files are present
3. `test-engine-functionality.ps1` - Tests if the engine can function properly
4. `run-engine.ps1` - Provides a menu for running services from the engine directory

## Key Changes

### P2A (formerly RP2A)
- Renamed directory from `RP2A` to `P2A`
- Updated `main.py` with new APP_NAME
- Updated README.md to reflect new name
- Modified schema export scripts to use "Engine" instead of "Orcha-1"

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with Engine title and proper clone instructions
- Updated references in Python scripts to use "Engine" instead of "Orcha-1"
- Updated schema references to point to Engine

## Next Steps

1. Begin using the `engine` directory as the primary development environment
2. Potentially archive or remove the old `orcha-1` directory once comfortable with the migration
3. Update any CI/CD pipelines to reference the new directory structure
4. Continue with the roadmap implementation using the new directory structure

## Verification

The migration has been verified with automated tests checking:
- Directory structure integrity
- File presence and contents
- Correct renaming of references
- Basic functionality

All validation tests have passed, indicating a successful migration.
